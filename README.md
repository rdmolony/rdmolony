I've mostly worked on closed-source projects to date, however, I do maintain a number of small, personal projects to serve my own needs -

- [`rdmolony/rdmolony.github.io`](https://github.com/rdmolony/rdmolony.github.io) - I host my own static website on `GitHub Pages`[^WEBSITE]
- [`rdmolony/my-wiki-infra`](https://github.com/rdmolony/my-wiki-infra) - I host my own wiki on [fly.io](https://fly.io/)[^WIKI]
- [`rdmolony/my-cv`](https://github.com/rdmolony/my-cv) - my CV is written in `LaTEX`[^CV]
- [`rdmolony/my-os`](https://github.com/rdmolony/my-os) - I run my laptop on `NixOS`[^OS]

## Footnotes

[^WEBSITE]: The website is generated via `Jekyll`, and styled via `TailwindCSS`

[^WIKI]: The wiki is an open source [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) server called [`TiddlyWiki`](https://tiddlywiki.com/). Having used [`Obsidian`](https://obsidian.md/) for years for tracking my thoughts, I've found this to be a slick tool for linking notes them together. Why host my own? Although there are hosted options (like [`TiddlyHost`](https://tiddlyhost.com/) I run my own server on [fly.io](https://fly.io/) simply because I can. I like having the ability to customise it to my hearts content. 

[^CV]: I put together a CV in `LaTEX` because CVs are still expected to be static documents (i.e. rendered to `pdf` or printed) & `LaTEX` is a great tool for making these documents beautiful

[^OS]: I wanted to more deeply familiarise myself with it, since I found it to be a powerful tool for creating reproducible developer environments. Instead of storing all applications on every backup, `NixOS` instead let's me store build instructions from which the applications can be derived. These build instructions are written in a simple language called `Nix`. `NixOS` makes the promise that these build instructions will be fully reproducible for years to come.
